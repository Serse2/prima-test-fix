## Report after test

- ❌ the test requires a list to be rendered whereas I used a simple div, so a refactor was made using correctly semantic html tags.

- ❌ Inside the test i change one expectation because if you search for "A" the results was 166 instead 41.

- ✅ The call returning the policies is asynchronous so I inserted the waitFor to check the tests.
